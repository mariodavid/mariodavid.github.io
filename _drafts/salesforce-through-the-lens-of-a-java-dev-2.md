This blog post series is about the my learnings that I had during working in the domain of Salesforce Development. I will try to put Salesforce into a broader context and compare it to previous experice - in particular CUBAs.

After elaborating the mindset and landscape in the first part let's go a little bit deeper into technical details in this part. 

## Declarative vs. Imperative Development

The first topic to talk about is the concept of declarative development. Declarative development in the land of Salesforce mainly means to configure parts of the solution by expressing the intend of what we would like to achieve instead of also express how we would like to get the solution to go there. This happens through a more or less user friendly & accessible user interface.

This concept is quite big in the Salesforce ecosystem and it is for good reasons. On the one side there is the target audience of tech-savy business people and Administrators, which benefit most of this kind of development. 

On the other hand, Salesforce runs the solutions the users design on their behalf as part of the Software-as-a-Service offering. This means that they have to take care that the stuff that some user creates is controllable when running their solution. Because Salesforce has to take care that an error that I as a builder / developer of the solution does not effect any other partner that runs on Salesforce.

Declarative development is much more controllable & restricable from the SaaS runtime perspective of Salesforce than imperative development mechanisms are.

But first and foremost I would say there is another reason and that is: it is oftentimes simply not necessary to use imperative development when the higher-level abstractions of declarative development is sufficient.

In order to make this abstarct explanation about declarative vs. imperativ development a little bit more concrete, let's take a look at a simple example.

## Salesforce Technology Landscape

Next let's explore a little bit the technology landscape of the Salesforce platform in order to get a better feeling of the overall space.

Broadly speaking, it is possible to put the available solutions & technologies into the following categories:

1. User Interface
2. Workflow & Automation
3. Business Logic & Database
4. Integration

Let's go through the categories to unfold these somewhat general terms.

Starting off with the "User Interface". It is obviously about creating user interfaces. But in Salesforce this can happen in various shapes and forms.
